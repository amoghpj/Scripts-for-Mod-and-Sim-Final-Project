# Scripts-for-Mod-and-Sim-Final-Project
Scripts and data used in the analysis and extension of Dobrovolny et al, 2010 for Mod and Sim of Bio Sys

# Agent Based Model
Uses grid_generator.py to generate a custom grid for spatial distribution of Default and Secondary target cells. This is the initialization over which the agent based simulation is carried out.
The ABM_simulatio.py script reads the grid file (saved as a .txt), and carries out 10 simualtions by default, and plots the individual profiles for Viral titer, relative populations of Target cells, populatiosn of eclipse cells ,and populations of infected cells.

# Stochastic Model
Contains 2 matlab scripts plotgen.m and twocellgillespie.m
